Part 2: Modifying Objects
Consider you need to update the book's information and add a new property:
Task 3) Add a property 'pageCount' with the value 1096 to the 'book' object.

Part 3: Advanced Object Operations 
Your libary system needs to handle multiple authors and include reviews for the book. 
Update the 'book' object to accommodate these requirements:
Task 6) Modify the 'author' property to hold an array of two authors: "David Flanagan" and "Another Author".
******************************************************************/

Update the 'book' object to accommodate these requirements:
Task 7) Add a 'reviews' property to the 'book' object, which will store an array of review objects. 
        Each review object should have 'reviewer' and 'comment' properties. 
        Start with one review: {reviewer: "Book Critic", comment: "A comprehensive guide to JavaScript."}.
